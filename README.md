# Algoritter

Algoritter is a Chrome extension that provides information about Twitter's ranking algorithm. Twitter currently offers two ways to view your timline (tweet feed): Chronological and Algorithmic. Most users use the algorithmically curated timeline as this is the default view. Algorithmically curated view changes the chronological order of the tweets based on your likings and other criteria that Twitter thinks is important for you. Algoritter aims to provide a bit more clarity, and marks the tweets that are promoted or demoted by Twitter's timeline algorithm.
